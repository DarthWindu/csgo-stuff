> This helps you check whether flashes or he-grenades hit their intended target in an offline server (e.g `map de_mirage` in console).
Follow the instructions printed in console after your `script_execute nadetraining` command to configure your binds. For me, `h` is bound to saving the nade trajectory while `j` is bound to un/pausing the script.
