# Descriptions

## AutoExec.cfg

## Bhop.cfg
> Allows easier bhopping (auto-bhop, enhanced air-strafe) in a practice server (e.g `map de_inferno` in console). I use this to avoid no-clipping short distances (which I find imprecise). 

## PracticeCfg.cfg
> Initializes a private server (e.g `map de_inferno` in console) as a private server. If you are practicing, this should be the first thing you execute after loading in. 

- Enables `sv_cheats`
- Gives you $60k
- 1 hour round time

Note: Do not execute this after starting [nadetraining.nut](../scripts/nadetraining.nut) --> it breaks the script.
